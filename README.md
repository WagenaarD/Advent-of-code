# Advent of code
I started doing advent of code in 2022 and merged all progress into a single github. I generally try to write solutions which strike a balance between fast, readable and concise. I might go back and do the older problems. 

## Solutions by year (Python)
|Year|Stars⭐|Theme|
|--|--|--|
|2015|50|Christmas|
|2016|-|Easter bunny|
|2017|-|Naughty or nice|
|2018|-|Anomolies|
|2019|-|Space|
|2020|50|Vacation|
|2021|8|Deep sea|
|2022|50|Jungle|
|2023|50|Snow|
|2024|50|History|
|2025*|14|Decorations|

*: In 2025, the elves learned project management. Their new efficiency reduced the number of required stars per year from 50 to 24.
